        Once upon a time, there was a girl who hated the cold and loved the sunshine. She loved mashed potatoes, cake, and naps. The girl loved long, hot baths too, especially with candles, but not when a cat fell into the tub with her. Birthdays were her favorite holiday, but a close second was Halloween. Basically, any chance she had to eat, dress up, and give was the very best and happiest of time. Hooray!! The girl grew up to do the GC front end daytime boot camp and met many new, interesting, and nice people. Let's all code and have fun!
